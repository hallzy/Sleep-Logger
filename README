This is a Sleep Logging program that I developed for my uncle, who after a
major skiing accident has had trouble staying asleep due to discomfort.
As a result, when he wakes up, he makes sure he takes note of what time
of the night he woke up at, along with some notes.

Before having this program, he would have to write it down on a piece of
paper after turning the lights on (and basically waking up) making it
harder for him to get back to sleep.

This easy to use program logs the time of the night at which the user 
clicks the enter button, and makes a text file with all the data.
